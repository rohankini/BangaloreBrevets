                                The ACP registers all brevets. Each brevet receives a verification number. These
                                are assigned chronologically based on time of receipt. The ACP has registered all
                                brevets since their inception in 1921.

                                These brevets are open to any amateur cyclist regardless of his or her cycling affiliations

                                During the event, each rider is considered to be on a personal ride. The rider must
                                ride in accordance with all applicable <strong>traffic codes</strong> and obey all
                                traffic signals. All safety guidelines has to be adhered to strictly – helmets and
                                gloves are compulsory. Anyone without a helmet will not be allowed to register or

                                    rear lights </strong>attached firmly to the vehicle. Lights must be fully functional
                                at all times (Spare lights are strongly recommended; spare bulbs are required).
                                At least one of the rear lights must be in a steady (rather than flashing) mode.
                                Riders not complying with all these requirements will not be permitted to start.

                                of the rider. For Bangalore Brevet rides, we will make available reflective vests
                                for cost price – or you can choose to purchase it yourself. Please do indicate this

                                Each rider must be self sufficient. No follow cars or support of any kind are permitted
                                on the course. Personal support is only allowed at checkpoints. Any violation of

                                At the start, if the organizer creates groups, as everyone rides at his or her own
                                pace, a rider could go out the group at any time. No rider can be considered as
                                group leader. All distinctive signs (jersey, armband, etc…)or title (road captain)
                                are not allowed. All riders are required to conduct themselves in a civil manner
                                and abide by all applicable vehicle codes, laws, and regulations. All riders are
                                required to respect local customs with regards to decorum.

                                At the start, each rider will receive a brevet card and a cue sheet indicating the
                                route and the location of the checkpoints. Riders must stay on the route. If a rider
                                leaves the route, they must return to the route at the same point prior to continuing,
                                ie. no shortcuts or detours from the route, unless specified by the organizer. Riders
                                must stop at each checkpoint to have their card stamped. Organizers may also include
                                unannounced checkpoints along the route. This assures that everyone will stay on
                                the prescribed route.

                                The organizer must use the Audax Club Parisien brevet cards or the local brevet
                                cards approved by Audax Club Parisien. Organizers may have checkpoints with no member
                                of the organizing staff present. At these checkpoints riders must get their brevet
                                card stamped at a local establishment that the organizer specifies as a checkpoint,
                                such as a grocery store or gas station. Checkpoint information to be noted on the
                                brevet card includes the time and the date of passage (for brevets that extend beyond
                                24 hours).

                                For unmanned checkpoints where no means of getting a stamp is available (arrival
                                in the middle of the night for example), the rider may either (1) mail in a postcard
                                with the checkpoint information (time, date, full name of the rider, and the rider's
                                club affiliation) to the brevet organizer; or (2) write into their brevet card identifying
                                information from a predetermined landmark or sign at the checkpoint also noting
                                the time and the date of passage. When the rider mails a postcard, the rider should
                                mark his brevet card in the space provided for the checkpoint: PC, with the time
                                and date the postcard was sent. The organizer has the discretion to determine which
                                option is to be allowed for a given checkpoint.

                                Missing checkpoint stamps, missing checkpoint times, or loss of the brevet card
                                (regardless of how far into the ride a rider is) <strong>will result in disqualification.</strong>
                                Each rider is responsible for seeing that his brevet card is properly completed
                                at each checkpoint.
                                <br />

                                Overall time limits vary for each brevet according to the distance. These are: (in
                                hours and minutes, HH:MM) 13:30 for 200 KM, 20:00 for 300 KM, 27:00 for 400 KM,
                                40:00 for 600 KM, and 75:00 for 1000 KM.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Additionally, riders must arrive at each checkpoint between the opening and closing
                                time for the checkpoint. These times are noted on the brevet card with the information
                                for the checkpoints. Riders must arrive at each checkpoint between the start and
                                the finish while the checkpoint is open. If a rider arrives at a checkpoint after
                                it has closed and the ride organizer is satisfied that the rider's lateness is due
                                to the occurrence of something unforeseen and beyond the control of the rider (such
                                as stopping to help at a traffic accident or a road closure), then the ride organizer
                                may waive the fact that the rider arrived at the control late and allow the rider
                                to continue. Poor bicycle or equipment maintenance, fatigue, lack of fitness, hunger,
                                etc. are not unforeseen and beyond the control of the rider and therefore will not
                                serve as a valid reason for being late. Subject to the foregoing, failure to make
                                all checkpoints, even if the brevet is done within the overall time limit, will
                                result in disqualification.
                                <br />

                                Any fraud, cheating, or deliberate violation of these rules will result in the exclusion
                                of the rider from all ACP sponsored events.

                                brevet has been verified and a brevet number issued. In the event of the organizer
                                losing a brevet card, no replacement to the rider will be made.

                                While taking part in a brevet, the riders accept the publication of their identity
                                and the time achieved in the results published by the organizers. Their identity
                                could never be used at commercial purposes or to be transmitted to a third for this
                                purpose.

                                Any rider who registers for and starts a brevet agrees by these actions to the following:
                                Any complaint or question concerning a brevet or its organization must be submitted
                                to the organizer in writing, within 48 hours from the finish of the brevet. The
                                organizer will review the complaint and forward it, with a recommendation, to the
                                “Commission des Randonneurs” of Audax Club Parisien for France or to the ACP local
                                ACP person responsible for outside France for a final decision.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Any question regarding the final decision will be sent to the Audax Club Parisien
                                board with organizer and ACP representative recommendations. The Audax Club Parisien
                                board will be the final arbiter of any complaints or questions that arise which
                                may not be covered explicitly in these rules.
